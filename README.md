TypeScript helpers for nominal typing

---

# Problem

- ðŸ˜€ Nominal types are [pretty useful](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/69abe49930761aea92dc564f9b6a5db74d6e1be9/src/compiler/types.ts#L1183-L1192).
- ðŸ˜ž TypeScript doesn't support nominal types ([yet?](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap/69ede9ef95de7bf8764a2f2fa3c3d4c441cc828d#future)).

Great! This is easy to fix right?
The simple trick below solves the problem.

```ts
declare const __brand: unique symbol;

declare const __type: unique symbol;

interface __Brand<T, S extends string> {
  [__brand]: S;
  [__type]: T;
}

export type Brand<T, S extends string> = T & __Brand<T, S>;
```

But then we encounter some more happy little problems.

```ts
type PlayerId = Brand<number, 'PlayerId'>;
type PlayerScores = Record<PlayerId, number>;

const myId = 1337 as PlayerId;
const scores: PlayerScores = { [myId]: 9001 };

// Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression
// of type 'Brand<number, "PlayerId">' can't be used to
// index type 'Record<Brand<number, "PlayerId">, number>'.
// ts(7053)
const myScore = scores[myId];
```

**nom-ts aims to address these problems.**

# Goals

- ðŸ¦… no dependencies
- ðŸ¦¥ all branded types in nom-ts are assignable to their underlying type
  without any additional syntax

# Code

```ts
interface __Flavor<T, S extends string> {
  [__brand]?: S;
  /**
   * Intersection is distributive over union, but we don't want to "lose" information about T.
   * `__type?: T` will be useful for Unbrand.
   */
  [__type]?: T;
}

export type Flavor<T, S extends string> = T & __Flavor<T, S>;

export type Unbrand<T> = T extends Flavor<infer X, any> ? X : T;

export const Unbrand = <T extends any>(x: T) => x as Unbrand<T>;

export type Dict<K extends PropertyKey, V> = Record<Unbrand<K>, V>;
```
